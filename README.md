# CM121_Final

To play: Extract zip file and open in Unity (I put a gitignore file in here, so you can't just download the zip).

Special Thanks:
-Almost all the logic for the enemies comes from Sebastian Lague's tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUdx_Nj4Xk0 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfhPBAe9Tt8
-Much of the logic surrounding effects comes from Unity's Survival Shooter series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l86gpYbQFzY
