# CM121_Final

To play: Extract zip file and open in Unity (I put a gitignore file in here, so you can't just download the zip).

Special Thanks:
-Almost all the logic for the enemies comes from Sebastian Lague's tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUdx_Nj4Xk0 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfhPBAe9Tt8
-Much of the logic surrounding effects comes from Unity's Survival Shooter series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l86gpYbQFzY
-The weapon model is from https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/sci-fi-gun-30826 (Sci-Fi Gun by Grasbock(
-The robot models come from https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Resources/SampleGames/ShooterGame, an Unreal Engine 4 Shooter example. I miscorrectly attributed it to https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/scifi-robots-113422 (this is based on what a commentor said. It's possbile that the Unity Asset Store robot model is original).
